# Algorithm Analysis

## Algorithms
Algorithms are a **set of instructions used to solve a problem**.

## Data Structures
Data structures are formats for storing, managing, working with or structuring data or information.
Every data structure has advantages and disdvantages.

### Arrays

<p align="center">

</p>

An array is a contiguous block of memory, which stores a collection of elements of same memory size and data type.

*Pros*: Highly efficient in accessing elements.

*Cons*: Fixed size once initialised.

### Linked List

<p align="center">

</p>

A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, which contain a data field and a reference to the next node in the list.
It is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

*Pros*: Dynamic sizing.

*Cons*: Low efficiency in accessing elements compared to array.

## Psuedocode

We can now try to put algorithm into psuedocode, a flexible style of code logic.

When this *Insertion Sort Algorithm* is adapted into Python for example, it'll look like this:

```python
# Insertion Sort
for i in range(1, len(array)):
    key = array[i]
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and array[j] > key:
        array[j + 1] = array[j]
        j -= 1
    array[j = 1] = key
```

**Control flow**

- if ... then ... [else ...]
- while ... do ...
- repeat ... until ...
- for ... do ...
- indentation replaces braces

**Method call**

- method (arg [, arg...])

**Return value**

- return *expression*

## Three Abstractions

### Computational problem
- defines a computational task
- specifies what the input is, and what the output should be

### Algorithm
- a step-by-step recipe to go from input to output (**what** your solution does)
- different from implementation

### Correctness and complexity analysis
- a formal proof that the algorithm solves the problem (**why** is what your solution does correct)
- analytical bound on the resources it uses
- what the running time of the algorithm is

**Example**

*Computational problem*: 
We are given an array *A* of integers and we need to return the maximum.

*Algorithm*: 
We go through all elements of the array in order, and keep track of the largest element.
For each position *i*, we check if the value stored at *A[i]* is larger than our current max, and if so update the max.
Then we return the maximum we found.

</p>

*Correctness*:
We maintain the following invariant: after the *k*-th iteration, *max* stores the maximum of the first *k* elements.

Prove using induction: $$\text{when }k=0,\text{ }max = -âˆž$$ which is the maximum of the first 0 elements.
