## Introduction to Trees
A tree is an abstract model of a **hierarchical structure**.

A tree consists of nodes with a parent-child relation.
- if ```u``` is a ```parent``` of ```v```, then ```v``` is a ```child``` of ```u```.
- a ```node``` has at most **one** parent in a tree.
- a ```node``` can have 0, one or more children.
