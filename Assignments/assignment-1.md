## ADVICE
- When designing a DSA:
1. briefly describe general idea
2. develop and elaborate

- Use lecture or textbook for proof

- Prove/explain/motivate answers

- When giving an algorithm, algorithm does not have to be given as psuedo-code or code.

- If you provide psuedo-code or code, then explain code and ideas in plain english.

- Always talk from worst-case analysis

- We are interested in the most efficient DSA

### Problem 1 (10 points)

Consider the following snippet of pseudocode that takes an array of $n$ integers.

</p>

Your task is to:

a) upperbound the running time of the algorithm in terms of $n$ using $O$-notation.

b) lowerbound the running time of the algorithm in terms of $n$ using $\OMEGA$ notation.
